Problem: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) <br>
Solution: [Link](https://github.com/codesnerd/LeetCode/blob/main/Algorithms/1.%20Two%20Sum.cpp)

## Brute Force Solution

### Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

- The outer loop goes over each element in the array and tries to find a match in the remaining array using the inner loop.
## Hashmap Solution

### Time Complexity: O(n)

1. This solution involves creating a hashmap that stores:
<div align="center">

| Key        | Value     |
| ---------- | --------- |
| The Number `nums[i]` | The Index `i` |
</div>

2. The loop runs throughout the array and at each index:
    1. Calculates the complement of the element we're currently on.
    2. Searches for the complement in the `map` and returns if it is found.
        1. `unordered_map.find()` has an average case complexity of `O(1)` and a [worst case complexity](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24155239/11917891) of `O(unordered_map.size())`.
    3. If the complement is not present, the element is inserted in the `map` as it might be a complement of an element yet to be visited in the array.
